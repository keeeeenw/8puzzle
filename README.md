8 puzzle parallelized solver using Branch and Bound algorithm

Compile the program using
    
    make all

Executable
    
    ./game                    runs the serial version of the solver

    sh run p                  runs parallel version (p is the number of processes)
    sh run_debug p            runs parallel version with debug option (p is the number of processes)
